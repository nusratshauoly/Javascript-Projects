Steps to solve:

1. Target of this game to guess a secter number butween 1 to 20.
2. So in the screen board we can type a number and then check and on the right side we got a message if the number is too low / high / correct number!
3. Here's score of 20 and for every wrong guess it will decrease 1 number.
4. HighScore is another feature of this application where we store the highest score point for winning the game.
5. If want to play this game again click Again button to start new but highscore will remain from previous player.
