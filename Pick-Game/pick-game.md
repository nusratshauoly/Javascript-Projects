Task of this project:

1. we have two players
2. the idea is the roll the dice
3. after rolling the dice any random number will appear and store in the current section and if again rolled the dice it will add number with previous number
4. we can hold the score by clicking (hold) button and that will store in the total score of the player and current score will be 0 and it will switch to player number 2 for play..
5. if the random number of dice comes 1 then we will lose all our current score and it'll be next players turn to play.
6. thats why we have hold the score before the next random number comes.
7. the first player between two player to reach 100 points wins the game.
8. Add a button called (new game), it will reset the game. and the dice will disappear and all score will set back to 0.

<!-- code process -->
