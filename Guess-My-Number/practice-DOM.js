// Video - 71: What's the DOM and DOM manipulation.
/*
DOM(Document Object Model): Structured representation of HTML Documents. Allows Javascript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.
Example: change text,HTML attributes and even CSS styles.

* DOM is a connection point between HTML documents and JAVASCRIPT code.

* DOM !== Javascript => DOM Methods and Properties for DOM Manipulation is not part of Javascript.

* DOM and DOM methods are actually part of something called the Web APIs.

* Web APIs(Application Programming Interface) are like libraries that browsers implement and that we can access from our Javascript code.

* Web APIs are basically libraries that are also written in Javascript and that are automatically available for us to use. All this happens behind the scenes, we don't have to import or do anything. There is actually an official DOM specification that browsers implement, which is the reason why DOM manipulation works the same in all browsers.

* Besides the DOM, there are actually a ton more web APIs, such as (timers, the fetch API) and many more.
